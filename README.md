# Consumable Tooltips

A mod for Minecraft that introduces a unified tooltip for consumable items, showing hunger, saturation, hydration, and supported special status effects. Created with the goal to show consistently styled attributes of items that may come from or be modified by different mods. Primarily intended for *Spice of Fabric* and my opinionated fork of *Dehydration* (soon to be renamed and prepated for publication). Inspired by the tooltip design of the *Spice of Valheim* mod.

## Features

The mod introduces the following features:

- Create an aesthetically pleasing, clean, and informative tooltip for consumables
- Values correspond to the exact number of üçó or üíß it restores in the HUD
- Display hunger and saturation values (like *AppleSkin*)
- Display hydration value (like *Dehydration*)
- Support for *Spice of Fabric* and dynamic food values (e.g. diminishing nutrition)
- Supports displaying an item's current player-specific value vs. its default values

It is highly recommended to disable the tooltip rendering of *AppleSkin* and *Dehydration* to remove duplicate information and let *Consumable Tooltips* handle all of it.

## Preview

## Development

The project depends on having a local version of my Dehydration fork that is loaded on configure. If you want to set up the project locally, you may have to also check out my fork of *Dehydration* and place the compiled *jar* file in `./libs/`, for example as `./libs/dehydration-1.4.1+forked.jar`. Update the include path in `build.gradle` as necessary.
